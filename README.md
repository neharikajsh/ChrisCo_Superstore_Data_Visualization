ChrisCo is a company that manages 40 venues around the United Kingdom and collects a massive quantity of data by using a loyalty card scheme to track every visit. In addition, six separate datasets from various categories must be evaluated. The data sets are:
• Daily Visitors in the venues for the year 2019
• Average age of the customer
• Maximum Distance travelled to reach each venue (in miles)
• Average time spent in each venue (in minutes)
• Rate of female visitors at each venue
• Average Money spent at each venue (in GBP)
The dataset is explored in two different data frames, ‘data’ for the daily visitors and ‘sum_data’ which is the complied data for all the rest of the datasets including sum of daily visitors.
